    	<h3>Career Summary</h3>
    	<p>In 2019 I decided it is time to pursue a professional career in programming. 
    	<p>I have been writing Java code since August 2019 after
    	enrolling for a programming Master Class and furthered 
      </p> my learning by pursuing the Oracle 1Z0-808 Associate exam to certify myself as a Java programmer. During that 
    	<p> period, LGIT Smart Solutions was appointed by Microsoft to host the ALC Gauteng Microsoft Challenge. I was part </p> 
    	<p> of the 3,000 enrolled  which was further narrowed down to 150 and I saw the entire program through to writing and</p> 
    	<p>passing my exam.  I was one of the top performers and I was appointed as a mentor to assist new intakes with their</p> 
    	<p> modules  and labs. As an OCA I intend on pursuing the 
    	Oracle Certified Professional (1Z0-809) certification along with </p> 
    	<p>the Amazon Web Service Developer Associate within my first year of working for a company to contribute
    	more to the team</p>
